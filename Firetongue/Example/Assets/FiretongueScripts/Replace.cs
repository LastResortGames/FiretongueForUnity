   * Simple class to do variable replacements for localization
   * 
   * USAGE:
       * var str:String = fire_tongue.get("$GOT_X_GOLD"); //str now = "You got <X> gold coins!"
       * str = Replace.flags(str,["<X>"],[num_coins]);	//num_coins = "10"
       * 
       * //str now = "You got 10 gold coins!"
   * 
   * This method is preferably to schemes that do this:
   * (str = "You got" + num_coins + " gold coins!")
   *  
   * Even if you translate the sentence fragments, each language has
   * its own unique word order and sentence structure, so trying to embed
   * that in code is a lost cuase. It's better to just let the translator 
   * specify where the variable should fall, and replace it accordingly.
